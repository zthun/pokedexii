# Description

Ash and his friends are on a new adventure to catch even more Pokemon! Before they set off on this journey they need
some tools. As we all know every great Pokemon trainer needs a reliable Pokedex to identify Pokemon. Itâ€™s a good thing
they requested Pokedexii! Now their pokedex is in the cloud!

## Road Map

- Adding details when a Pokemon is selected

- Adding e2e tests
- Adding a personal backend for better caching of Pokemon in accordance with the Pokemon API. (Onion)
- Adding item and machine lists.
- Adding images for pokemon that do not exist.
